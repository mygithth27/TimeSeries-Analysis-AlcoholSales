# TimeSeries-Analysis-AlcoholSales
Time Series Analysis of alcohol Sales data with AR method and direct forecasting approach.

The aim of the project is to make a decomposition analysis of (time series) alcohol sales data and to perform forecasting using two methods: AR method (ARIMA/SARIMA model) and direct forecasting (Machine Learning/Deep Learning). A discussion is made from the results by comparing both methods and the used models.
